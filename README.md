# web-scraping-challenge

# Project Overview

By using beautiful soup, splinter, flask and MongoDB I scrap different webpages in order to build an application that displays relevant information about NASA mission to mars

# Application Overview

1. I start by scrapping [redplanetscience](https://redplanetscience.com/) in order to get the latest news from the mission to Mars
    - Initial scrap returns only empty results. The page only loads the news content with an onclick event, will use splinter to overcome this
